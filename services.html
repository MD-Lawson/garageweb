        <h2>Car still under warranty?</h2>
        <p>You may think that because your new vehicle is still under the manufacturers warranty you are unable to take advantage of Crown Garage's competitive service prices and outstanding quality workmanship.</p>

<p >In October 2003, European legislation affecting the Motor Trade came into force. Its full title is Block Exemption Regulation 1400/2002 and prior to this, it was very difficult to have any car still under warranty serviced outside of a main dealer.</p>

<p>Now, the EU Commission makes it clear that a customer shall not lose his warranty claims against the vehicle manufacturer if a ‘normal service’ or ‘repair work’ has been carried out by an independent specialist repair outlet.</p>

    <p>Not only does this legislation cover the two or three years’ warranty, it also expressly covers any extended guarantees and other contractual warranties set out by the manufacturers.</p>

<p>In short the ruling states that all work carried out on a vehicle must be carried out by a fully trained person and they must only use original parts or parts of the same standard or a better standard. Here at Crown Garage we only use original parts or ‘OEM’ parts. Original Equipment Manufactured (OEM) parts or parts that are made by an the vehicle manufacturer or an external company for the vehicle manufacture, where we can we source the parts direct from the external company, thus cutting out the middle man and saving money without compromising on quality.</p>

<p>Your vehicle seller may be claiming that unless your new car is serviced by the selling outlet, that the warranty may be invalid. So give us a call on 01538 382600 to take advantage of our low service and repair costs.</p>
        
        <h3>M.O.T</h3>
        <p>Here at Crown Garage we offer quality and reliable M.O.T servicing at low competitive prices. For more information or to book an M.O.T Please call us on 01538 382600</p>
